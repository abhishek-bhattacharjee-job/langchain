The history of computers dates back to the early 19th century when Charles Babbage conceived the idea of a mechanical computer. However, it wasn't until the mid-20th century that electronic computers became a reality. The ENIAC, built in 1945, is considered one of the earliest general-purpose electronic computers. Over the years, computers have evolved significantly in terms of size, power, and capabilities. The invention of the microprocessor in the 1970s revolutionized the industry and paved the way for personal computers, leading to the computer revolution in the 1980s.
