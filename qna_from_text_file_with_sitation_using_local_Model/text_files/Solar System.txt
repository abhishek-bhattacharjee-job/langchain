The solar system comprises the Sun and all the celestial objects that orbit it, including planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The Sun, a massive ball of hot plasma, accounts for over 99% of the total mass of the solar system. The four inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are rocky and relatively small, while the outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are gas giants with thick atmospheres. Pluto was considered the ninth planet until its reclassification as a dwarf planet in 2006. The solar system is vast and offers fascinating insights into the workings of the universe.
